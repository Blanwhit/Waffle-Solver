This project is an open-source terminal-based solver for https://wafflegame.net

The code generates solved waffle boards after taking an unsolved waffle game as an input

To run it, launch main.py\n
Input your waffle exactly as you see it on the screen\n
On an average machine, an average Waffle should take around 3-5 minutes to solve completely\n
You might need to wait up to 20 minutes for slower machines and harder Waffles

The algorithm will solve the Waffle completely using a list of 2315 5-letter words

For now, the project only supports daily waffles (5x5), but support for 7x7 Waffles is on the roadmap
Other things on the roadmap include:
-A solver that suggests the best swaps you can make to guarantee 5 stars every time
-Optimisation for the current solver, possibly migrating computationally complex parts to C++
