This project is an open-source terminal-based solver for https://wafflegame.net

The code generates solved waffle boards after taking an unsolved waffle game as an input

To run it, launch main.py  
Input your waffle exactly as you see it on the screen  
On an average machine, an average Waffle should take around 3-5 seconds to solve completely

The algorithm will solve the Waffle completely using a list of 14855 5-letter words (All the words accepted by Wordle)

For now, the project only supports daily waffles (5x5), but support for 7x7 Waffles is on the roadmap

Other things on the roadmap include:\
-A more user-friendly input system\
-A solver that accounts for yellow letters
